# TREE

* Non linear data structure, b/c it does not store the data in sequential manner.

* Defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together or simulate hierarchy.

* Each nodes contains some data & the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children.

## Important terms related to Tree.

* **Root Node :** Complete tree is referenced using this node & it does not have any parent.
* **Parent Node :** Immediate predecessor of a node.
* **Child node :** All immediate successor of a node are called child node.
* **Siblings :** Nodes with the same parents.
* **Leaf :** Last node in the tree. There is no node after leaf node.
* **Edge :** Connection between two nodes.
* **Path :** Successive edges from source node to destination node.
* **Degree of a Node :** Equals to number of children of that node.
* **Depth of a Node :** It represents the number of edges from the root node to this node.
* **Height of a Node :** It is the number of edges on the longest path between that node & a leaf.
* **Height of the Tree :** Its the height of root node of that tree.

## Different types of tree.

* General Tree
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree
* Spanning Tree
* B Tree
* B+ Tree
* HEAP

## Applications of Tree data structures.

* Used in storing hierarchical data, like organization structure, folder structure, etc..
* Used in storing router-tables in routers.
* Used by Compilers to build Syntax trees.
* Used to implement expression parsers.
* BST is a tree helps in faster search, insert, delete on a sorted data.
* HEAP is a tree implemented using arrays & used to implement priority queues.
* B Tree & B+ Trees are used to implement indexing in databases.
