Name mangling:

    - C++ achieve function overloading with the help of name mangling.
    - C++ compliler changes the name of the functions when it generate the object code... it chnages the name by adding some info about the argumnets.
        This technique of adding additional info to the function name is called Name mangling.

        C++ does not specify any specific method to do so... hence different compiler used different techniques to achieve the same.

        when some code is put inside `extern “C”` the C++ compiler ensures that the functions name are unmangled.
        
        during compilation and the same updated name is stored in the symbol table which is used for the fcuntion calls etc..
        eg. name of the fucntion is fun() .. but in the symbol table it is stored like _Zfunc ......
